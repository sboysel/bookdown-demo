This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).

1. Open this repository in RStudio.
2. Open `index.Rmd` and click the `Knit` button.
3. Assuming `bookdown` and `servr `are installed, `bookdown::serve_book()`.

You can find the preview of this example at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown-demo/
